ReadDB is client-server software for storing and accessing mapped short
reads.

Server Setup
============

You need to create a directory for ReadDB that contains the following files

users.txt
---------

one line per user, in the format
username:password

The users.txt file is re-read each time a user attempts to authenticate,
so you can modify it while the server is running.

groups.txt
----------

one line per group, in the format
groupname: userone usertwo userthree

Groups let you assign permissions to multiple users at once.  The
special group "admin" is for users who can shut down the server, add
users, and add users to groups.

defaultACL.txt
--------------

This is the default, initial ACL for new alignments.  It looks like

read: groupone usertwo grouptwo
write: grouptwo usertwo
admin: usertwo


admin is the set of users and groups who can change the ACL.



Starting the Server
===================

Once users.txt, groups.txt, and defaultACL.txt are in place (eg, in
"datadir"), you can start the server with

 java -Xmx3G -cp readdb.jar edu.mit.csail.cgs.projects.readdb.Server -M \
 400 -d datadir -p 52000 -C 400

-p is the port number to listen on
-M is the number of connections to allow
-C is the number of files to cache
-t is the number of threads to spawn

The server will log on STDERR.

I haven't done extensive testing to correlate the java heap size and the
number of cached files.  3GB seems adequate for our usage and 400
files.  Don't be too alarmed if you see high memory usage with top or
other tools- ReadDB uses mmap to access data files.  The full file size
will be included in the process's virtual size even if the data isn't in
RAM.  

Client Setup
============

The client software will look for a ~/.readdb_passwd file that looks
like

username=userone
passwd=mypassword
hostname=readdb.csail.mit.edu
port=52000


Loading Data
============

You can load data by passing it on STDIN to 

java -cp readdb.jar edu.mit.csail.cgs.projects.readdb.ImportHits --align \
alignmentname

Lines for unpaired reads must be tab delimited with the following
fields:
1) chromosome (integer)
2) position
3) strand
4) length
5) weight

Lines for paired reads must be tab delimited with the following fields
1) chromosome for left read
2) pos for left read
3) strand for left read
4) length for left read
5) chromosome for right read
6) pos for right read
7) strand for right read
8) length for right read
9) weight (applies to the whole pair)


edu.mit.csail.cgs.projects.readdb.SAMToReadDB will convert from SAM/BAM
format to ReadDB, except that it does not convert string chromosome
identifiers to the numeric identifiers needed by ReadDB.  Feel free to
modify it to suit your local convention for non-numeric chromosomes.

Command Line Queries
====================

edu.mit.csail.cgs.projects.readdb.Query is the basic query class.  It
reads regions (eg, "4:1000000-2000000" or "15:0-10000:+") on STDIN and
produces output on STDOUT with either aligned read information or a
histogram.

--align specifies the alignment to query
--histogram 40 says to produce a histogram with 40bp bins
--weights says to include alignment weights in the output
--paired says to query paired reads rather than single-ended reads
--noheader says not to print the queried region on STDOUT

edu.mit.csail.cgs.projects.readdb.ReadDB provides additional query
functionality as

edu.mit.csail.cgs.projects.readdb.ReadDB takes a command and additional
args.  Commands are
  exists alignmentname
  getchroms alignmentname
  getacl alignmentname
  setacl alignmentname user add write  
  setacl alignmentname user delete read
  getcount alignmentname
    (gets the number of hits in the alignment)
  getcount alignmentname chromosome
  addtogroup username groupname
